// #3 If you could change 1 thing about your favorite framework/language/platform (pick one), what would it be?

/* I would pick ReactJs for this question because it is the one that I use the most and I would say it is my favorite.
  If I could change something it would be to be more live data friendly, which is something I learned from using the
  Phoenix framework. In Phoenix there are already web sockets and channels ready to be used for building real time
  applications and in ReactJs you would have to add libraries like socket.io or pusher to serve your realtime features
  in your applications.
